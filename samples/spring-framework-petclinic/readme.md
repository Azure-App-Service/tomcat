# Spring PetClinic Sample Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic/)

Approved by the Spring team, this repo is a fork of the [spring-projects/spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic).
It allows the Spring community to maintain a Petclinic version with a plain old **Spring Framework configuration**
and with a **3-layer architecture** (i.e. presentation --> service --> repository).
The "canonical" implementation is now based on Spring Boot, Thymeleaf and [aggregate-oriented domain]([https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic/pull/200). 


## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
[See the presentation here](http://fr.slideshare.net/AntoineRey/spring-framework-petclinic-sample-application) (2017 update)

## Running petclinic locally
```
	git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic.git
	cd spring-framework-petclinic
	./mvnw tomcat7:run-war
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:9966/petclinic/

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which
gets populated at startup with data.
A similar setups is provided for MySql and PostgreSQL in case a persistent database configuration is needed.
To run petclinic locally using persistent database, it is needed to run with profile defined in main pom.xml file.

For MySQL database, it is needed to run with 'MySQL' profile defined in main pom.xml file.

```
./mvnw tomcat7:run-war -P MySQL
```

Before do this, would be good to check properties defined in MySQL profile inside pom.xml file.

```
<properties>
    <jpa.database>MYSQL</jpa.database>
    <jdbc.driverClassName>com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</jdbc.driverClassName>
    <jdbc.url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/petclinic?useUnicode=true</jdbc.url>
    <jdbc.username>root</jdbc.username>
    <jdbc.password>petclinic</jdbc.password>
</properties>
```      

You may also start a MySql database with docker:

```
docker run --name mysql-petclinic -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=petclinic -e MYSQL_DATABASE=petclinic -p 3306:3306 mysql:5.7.8
```

For PostgreSQL database, it is needed to run with 'PostgreSQL' profile defined in main pom.xml file.

```
./mvnw tomcat7:run-war -P PostgreSQL
```

Before do this, would be good to check properties defined in PostgreSQL profile inside pom.xml file.

```
<properties>
    <jpa.database>POSTGRESQL</jpa.database>
    <jdbc.driverClassName>org.postgresql.Driver</jdbc.driverClassName>
    <jdbc.url>jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/petclinic</jdbc.url>
    <jdbc.username>postgres</jdbc.username>
    <jdbc.password>petclinic</jdbc.password>
</properties>
```
You may also start a Postgres database with docker:

```
docker run --name postgres-petclinic -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=petclinic -e POSTGRES_DB=petclinic -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:9.6.0
```

## Working with Petclinic in Eclipse/STS

### prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Maven 3 (http://www.sonatype.com/books/mvnref-book/reference/installation.html)
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Eclipse with the m2e plugin (m2e is installed by default when using the STS (http://www.springsource.org/sts) distribution of Eclipse)

Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in Help -> About dialog.
If m2e is not there, just follow the install process here: http://eclipse.org/m2e/download/


### Steps:

1) In the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/spring-petclinic/spring-framework-petclinic.git
```
2) Inside Eclipse
```
File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
```

## Interaction with other open source projects

One of the best parts about working on the Spring Petclinic application is that we have the opportunity to work in direct contact with many Open Source projects. We found some bugs/suggested improvements on various topics such as Spring, Spring Data, Bean Validation and even Eclipse! In many cases, they've been fixed/implemented in just a few days.
Here is a list of them:

| Name | Issue |
|------|-------|
| Spring JDBC: simplify usage of NamedParameterJdbcTemplate | [SPR-10256](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10256) and [SPR-10257](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-10257) |
| Bean Validation / Hibernate Validator: simplify Maven dependencies and backward compatibility |[HV-790](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-790) and [HV-792](https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HV-792) |
| Spring Data: provide more flexibility when working with JPQL queries | [DATAJPA-292](https://jira.springsource.org/browse/DATAJPA-292) |
| Dandelion: improves the DandelionFilter for Jetty support | [113](https://github.com/dandelion/dandelion/issues/113) |
